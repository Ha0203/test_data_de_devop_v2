| **Attribution Logic**   | Must be designed manually                             | Pre-built with configurable rules                          |
| **Device Matching**     | Requires development of fingerprinting & deep linking | Built-in advanced device ID and probabilistic matching     |
| **Cross-Platform Sync** | Manual sync between mobile/web tracking layers        | Unified SDK and reporting stack                            |
| **Fraud Detection**     | Needs custom heuristics                               | Built-in fraud protection and real-time blocking           |
| **Analytics Dashboard** | Custom BI implementation required                     | Real-time dashboard with cohort analysis                   |
| **Raw Data Exports**    | Must build API or database extraction manually        | Provides Data Locker (S3) and Pull API with schema support |
| **API Access**          | Requires full backend dev for ingestion & reporting   | RESTful API access for pull reports, events, and cost data |
| **Cost**                | High initial engineering cost, low marginal cost      | Subscription-based with varying tiers                      |
| **Compliance**          | Must implement data protection and consent tracking   | Built-in compliance framework with regional controls       |

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant User
    participant App
    participant AppsFlyerSDK
    participant AppsFlyerBackend
    participant Dashboard

    User->>App: Clicks ad tracking link
    App->>AppsFlyerSDK: Launches with embedded SDK
    AppsFlyerSDK->>AppsFlyerBackend: Sends install + device info
    AppsFlyerBackend-->>AppsFlyerSDK: Returns attribution result
    AppsFlyerSDK->>AppsFlyerBackend: Tracks in-app events
    AppsFlyerBackend-->>Dashboard: Updates real-time reports
```

---

#### Raw Data Export Options

* **Pull API**: RESTful API to retrieve aggregated data (attribution, performance, event stats).
* **Data Locker**: Continuous raw data export to AWS S3 (supports event-level granularity).
* **Cloud Integrations**: Direct export connectors for BigQuery, Snowflake, Redshift.

#### API Integration Use Cases

* **Sync with Internal BI Tools**

  * Schedule API calls to fetch daily event summaries.

* **Campaign Reporting**

  * Combine AppsFlyer data with CRM or ad-spend reports for ROI calculations.

* **User Journey Analysis**

  * Map custom funnels using exported in-app events and attribution metadata.

    participant User
    participant App
    participant TrackingSDK
    participant AttributionEngine
    participant InternalDB
    participant Dashboard

    User->>App: Clicks campaign link with custom params
    App->>TrackingSDK: Launches with manual SDK
    TrackingSDK->>AttributionEngine: Sends install + campaign info
    AttributionEngine->>InternalDB: Records attribution result
    App->>TrackingSDK: Logs in-app events
    TrackingSDK->>InternalDB: Stores event data
    InternalDB-->>Dashboard: BI tool queries for reports
```

---

#### Engineering Requirements

* **Tracking SDK**

  * Must create platform-specific SDKs (Android/iOS/Web) to collect and send data.

* **Attribution Engine**

  * Match install links to stored campaign clicks using device fingerprints or cookies.

* **Database Schema**

  * Design scalable storage models for user-level event history and attribution chains.

* **API Layer**

  * Build endpoints to expose events and attribution data for analytics.

* **ETL Pipelines**

  * Transfer data to BI tools or dashboards (e.g., Airflow + Redshift).

### Problems Solved by AppsFlyer

<details>
<summary>Challenges of custom tracking and how AppsFlyer solves them</summary>

---

#### Attribution Complexity

* **Custom System**: Requires full implementation of fingerprinting, deep linking, and campaign tracking logic.
* **AppsFlyer**: Handles attribution via deterministic and probabilistic methods automatically.

---

#### Data Reliability & Accuracy

* **Custom System**: Attribution often breaks due to iOS/Android changes, cookie loss, or anti-tracking policies.
* **AppsFlyer**: Regular updates and platform support for latest privacy standards.

---

#### Cross-Device Tracking

* **Custom System**: Hard to unify user behavior across web and app.
* **AppsFlyer**: Built-in support for unified user identity with deep linking and People-Based Attribution.

---

#### Fraud Prevention

* **Custom System**: Difficult to detect bot installs or click spamming.
* **AppsFlyer**: Includes Protect360 with anomaly detection, real-time blocking, and network scoring.

---

#### Engineering Overhead

* **Custom System**: Ongoing effort needed for maintenance and SDK updates.
* **AppsFlyer**: Minimal maintenance; handles updates and SDK compatibility.

### Implementation Considerations

<details>
<summary>Strategic factors in choosing AppsFlyer over custom tracking</summary>

---

* **Team Size and Capacity**

  * Small teams benefit from offloading tracking logic to AppsFlyer.

* **Speed to Market**

  * Marketing teams can test campaigns faster without waiting for backend engineering cycles.

* **Need for Ad Network Integration**

  * AppsFlyer integrates with 100+ networks (Google Ads, Meta, TikTok) by default.

* **Security and Compliance Needs**

  * AppsFlyer supports consent mode, GDPR/CCPA tagging, and regional data hosting.

* **Analytics Requirements**

  * If in-house BI tools exist, raw data exports (Pull API, Data Locker) can be used.

* **Cost Justification**

  * Early-stage startups might prefer custom solutions; mid-to-large orgs save more with managed service.
