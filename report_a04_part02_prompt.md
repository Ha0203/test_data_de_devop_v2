## GenAI Usage Prompt - AppsFlyer Integration Assessment (A04b)

---

### Prompt Objective

<details>
<summary>Clarify the goal of using GenAI for this documentation task</summary>

---

* Develop a fully structured, markdown-compliant technical report evaluating **AppsFlyer** as a mobile tracking solution.
* Compare AppsFlyer with a **custom-built tracking system** across setup, data flow, integration, and compliance.
* Use GenAI to generate:

  * Markdown layout using `ctx_doc_style.md` rules
  * Tables comparing systems
  * Mermaid diagrams for event flows
  * Bullet-point documentation for technical architecture and considerations

---

</details>

### High-Level Guidance Given to GenAI

<details>
<summary>Instructions and criteria provided for output creation</summary>

---

* Ensure the document structure complies with `ctx_doc_style.md`
* Incorporate at least:

  * One technical comparison table
  * Two Mermaid diagrams (AppsFlyer and custom flow)
  * Technical details about APIs, data export, fraud protection, compliance
* Format content into `<details>` blocks with appropriate `---` separators
* Keep all content bullet-based and non-numbered
* Emphasize strategic, engineering, and business-level decision factors

---

</details>

### GenAI Contributions

<details>
<summary>Sections authored or enhanced using GenAI tooling</summary>

---

* **Overview of Commercial Tracking Platforms**: Synthesized from public knowledge of attribution platforms
* **Comparison Table**: Generated via structured breakdown of criteria
* **Mermaid Diagrams**:

  * AppsFlyer lifecycle: auto-rendered to illustrate SDK and backend interaction
  * Custom system: illustrates a typical in-house solution with DB and attribution logic
* **API & Raw Data Export Details**: Generated with common use cases, tools, and integration flows
* **Implementation Considerations**: Guided by user input to reflect real-world project priorities

---

</details>

### Tools Used

<details>
<summary>GenAI tools involved in prompt-to-report transformation</summary>

---

* **ChatGPT (Custom Instructions Enabled)**:

  * For markdown structure, comparison analysis, and narrative framing
  * Mermaid syntax generation and section formatting validation

* **Contextual Awareness**:

  * Utilized uploaded files: `ctx_doc_style.md` and `test_data_de_devop_v2.pdf`
  * Matched style rules (e.g., heading hierarchy, block separation)

* **Mermaid Visualization Support**:

  * Prompted GenAI to render accurate sequence diagrams to illustrate event flows

---

</details>

### Outcome Assessment

<details>
<summary>Impact and effectiveness of GenAI assistance</summary>

---

* Reduced turnaround time for generating compliant, highly structured documentation
* Accelerated technical framing of AppsFlyer vs. Custom tracking approaches
* Enhanced clarity via visual diagrams and standardized comparisons
* Produced business-accessible insights in tandem with engineering details
